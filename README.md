# Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Linux (tested only in linux, other OS isn't guaranteed)
- Terminal (App only works in command line by now)

# What is the app?
 It is a simple password manager that uses a password to encrypt the data and make it more secure
 Although it can be used already there are some issues that i need to take care of and in the futu-
 re i will make a window for it to be use despite having an terminal or not
 
 # to-do list
 - fix delete option issue
 - create an window for the app
 - create a backup version if the password is forgot (not that important now compared to other functions)
